Steps in the Script
Use second-level headings for major sections like "Steps in the Script".

## Steps in the Script
Import Necessary Libraries
Use third-level headings for subsections like "Import Necessary Libraries".

### Import Necessary Libraries

python import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import warnings from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

Repeat this structure for each step in your script, replacing "Import Necessary Libraries" with the appropriate title for each section.

Notes
For notes or important considerations, you can use italic text or bold text to emphasize certain points.

### Notes

Ensure all required libraries are installed before running the script.  
The dataset "life expectancy data.csv" should be in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file.  
Warnings are suppressed in the script for cleaner output, but it's recommended to review them in a real-world scenario.
